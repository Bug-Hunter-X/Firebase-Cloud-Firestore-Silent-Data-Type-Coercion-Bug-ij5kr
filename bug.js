In a Firebase project, when using Cloud Firestore, an uncommon error can occur if you try to update a document with a field that has a data type different than what it originally was. For example, if a field is initially defined as a string but you later try to update it with a number, Firebase might not throw an explicit error but instead might silently coerce the data, leading to unexpected behavior in your application. This can be very hard to debug, especially in large applications.

```javascript
//Incorrect data type update in Cloud Firestore
db.collection('users').doc('someID').update({
  age: '25'
}).then(() => {
  console.log('Document updated successfully!');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error updating document:', error);
});
```
