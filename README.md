# Firebase Cloud Firestore Data Type Coercion Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Firebase Cloud Firestore where attempting to update a document field with an inconsistent data type may not result in an error, but rather silent data type coercion. This can lead to unexpected application behavior and debugging challenges.

## The Bug

The issue occurs when a document field's data type is changed during updates.  Firestore might implicitly convert the data, potentially causing unexpected behavior and logical errors in your application.  For example, updating a string field with a number could lead to data loss or unexpected comparisons.

## The Solution

The best solution is to prevent data type mismatches at the application level by carefully validating and type-checking your data before sending updates to Firestore.  Use strong typing in your application code to prevent accidental data type changes.  Implementing robust data validation within your application before writing to the database is crucial.

## Reproducing the Bug

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Set up a Firebase project and initialize the Firestore database.
3.  Configure the Firebase SDK in `bug.js`.
4.  Run `bug.js` to see the incorrect data type update.
5.  Run `bugSolution.js` to see how to implement input validation to avoid this problem.
